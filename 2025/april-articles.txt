- I read Tyler Cowen's post on Marginal Revolution titled "My history with
philosophy" <https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/04/my-history-with-philosophy.html>
      - I learned about Lysander Spooner's response to social contract theory
      in the essays "The Consitution of No Authority" 1,2, and 6.
