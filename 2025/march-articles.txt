-- Read: The Hypercuriosity Theory of ADHD
    An Interview with Anne-Laure Le Cunff by Gurjot Brar
    1800 words

- From the Evolution and Psychiatry Substack <https://epsig.substack.com/>

- Interesting take on ADHD; research found that the literature lacked an
advantage-based explanation of ADHD and focused on deficits.

- Here's what GPT-4.5 had to summarize the interview:
    - Evolutionary Mismatch of Curiosity: The interview outlines how ADHD 
    traits like distractibility and impulsivity may result from an evolutionary 
    mismatch—where high trait curiosity was once adaptive for exploration and 
    survival in unpredictable, resource-scarce environments but now conflicts 
    with modern, structured settings.
    - Integration of Neuroscience and Evolutionary Psychology: The theory 
    builds on prior evolutionary research and incorporates neuroscientific 
    and psychological findings to argue that hypercuriosity drives both 
    beneficial exploratory behaviors and the challenges 
    (e.g., shifting focus) commonly seen in ADHD.
    - Implications for Strength-Based Interventions: By reframing ADHD 
    as involving adaptive traits, the theory suggests that interventions 
    should harness natural curiosity—such as through personalized, engaging 
    educational methods—instead of solely focusing on mitigating deficits.

-- Read: Federal Land Can Be Home Sweet Home
   by Scott Turner and Doug Burgum

- For the Wall Street Journal 
<https://www.wsj.com/opinion/federal-land-can-be-home-sweet-home-joint-task-
force-hud-interior-department-housing-affordability-3a281d36?mod=Searchresults_
pos2&page=1>

- "The Interior Department oversees more than 500 million acres of federal 
land, much of it suitable for residential use. The Department of Housing and 
Urban Development brings expertise in housing policy and community development. 
Together we are creating the Joint Task Force on Federal Land for Housing to 
increase housing supply and decrease costs for millions of Americans."

- "Streamlining the regulatory process is a cornerstone of this partnership. 
Historically, building on federal land is a nightmare of red tape—lengthy 
environmental reviews, complex transfer protocols and disjointed agency 
priorities. This partnership will cut through the bureaucracy. 
Interior will reduce the red tape behind land transfers or leases to public 
housing authorities, nonprofits and local governments."

- Skeptical on this take; mostly because it promises that federal land will
be handled more efficiently than it already is.
