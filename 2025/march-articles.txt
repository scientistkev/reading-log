// Read: The Hypercuriosity Theory of ADHD
// An Interview with Anne-Laure Le Cunff by Gurjot Brar
From the Evolution and Psychiatry Substack <https://epsig.substack.com/>
- Interesting take on ADHD; research found that the literature lacked an
advantage-based explanation of ADHD and focused on deficits.
- Here's what GPT-4.5 had to summarize the interview:
    - Evolutionary Mismatch of Curiosity: The interview outlines how ADHD 
    traits like distractibility and impulsivity may result from an evolutionary 
    mismatch—where high trait curiosity was once adaptive for exploration and 
    survival in unpredictable, resource-scarce environments but now conflicts 
    with modern, structured settings.
    - Integration of Neuroscience and Evolutionary Psychology: The theory 
    builds on prior evolutionary research and incorporates neuroscientific 
    and psychological findings to argue that hypercuriosity drives both 
    beneficial exploratory behaviors and the challenges 
    (e.g., shifting focus) commonly seen in ADHD.
    - Implications for Strength-Based Interventions: By reframing ADHD 
    as involving adaptive traits, the theory suggests that interventions 
    should harness natural curiosity—such as through personalized, engaging 
    educational methods—instead of solely focusing on mitigating deficits.
